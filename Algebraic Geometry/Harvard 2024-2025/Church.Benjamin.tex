\title{Nonvanishing $1$-forms on varieties admitting a good minimal model.}

\maketitle

\abstract{
Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety and $\omega \in H^0(X, \Omega_X^1)$ a $1$-form with no zeros. A theorem of Popa and Schnell says that $X$ is not of general type. We investigate further restrictions on the geometry of $X$. In particular, we show that $X$ must be close to an isotrivial fibration over an abelian variety. }
